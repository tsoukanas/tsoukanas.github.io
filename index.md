I come from a background which combines knowledge from Marketing and Informatics. Asking questions that are challenging is my passion, and answering them with the help of statistical learning is my goal. I prefer working collectively, rather than atomically, but the interesting overturn of the societal norms in the years '20-'21 introduced a more solitary way of everyday life. These circumstances did not influence the chances to continue my research interests by being a part of a brilliant scientific family as a doctoral student of the ISL group at the University of Thessaly.
